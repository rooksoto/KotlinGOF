# Gang Of Four Patterns

### An implementation in Kotlin

___

#### Why does this repo exist?

I started a new job recently and, due to our GitHub setup, what I commit there won't be reflected on my personal
heatmap. I'm super sad about this, but security is priority one nowadays, and I'm **all** about protecting my employer's
IP.

The engineering book club at work is going over
the [Gang of Four design patterns](https://www.gofpatterns.com/index.php), so I've decided to keep a repo of my
implementations, using Kotlin (because it's my stack's core language, and also because it's the bees-knees, item 9).

I did these a few years ago in Java, following a course on Udemy. Back then, I didn't quite appreciate the usefulness of
these patterns - that is to say, the elegance with which they solve those engineering problems they're intended to
solve. A few years have gone by, and I've written a fair bit of code in a commercial setting. I've had call to
understand and implement some of these gems in the real world. They're indispensable.

To that end, I'm going to keep this repo public. There are certainly other (often better) Kotlin implementations of the
GOF Patterns readily available. Some may find it useful to compare those against this repo and reason about why a given
implementation might be more or less favorable. I may or may not do a good job documenting this code, and I will almost
certainly edit this [README](README.md) file lots.
